Currently, I am Data Scientist at Expedia and also a Ph.D. student at WPI. I am doing my research on continuation methods for Deep Learning Optimization with Prof. Randy Paffenroth. 
I have worked on a diverse set of applications of computer vision for example, GANs, Image classification, compression and object detection. Also, in NLP I have done industry projects of one plus year length. 
These include Text classification, Named Entity Recognition, Text similarity and Learning to rank frameworks.
